# landing_page_project
This landing page was created as my first project after learning felxbox in The Odin Project. 
I followed their guidlines, yet took creative liberties along the way. 
I challenged myself to go futher than what was initially required of me by learning new concepts along the way, 
like how to make a chrome looking gradient on a button, for example.
